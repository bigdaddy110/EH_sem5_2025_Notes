📄 Assignment 20: Check Internet Exposure via Shodan
Name: George Thomas
Register Number: 2462072

📌 Objective
The purpose of this assignment is to investigate the visibility of internet-connected devices and services using Shodan. By analyzing a public IP address, the assignment demonstrates how attackers can gather information about exposed systems and helps identify steps to improve personal or organizational cybersecurity.

🛠️ Methodology
Searched my public IP on Shodan.

Collected IP information from https://whatismyipaddress.com and IP location tools.

Gathered available data: ASN, ISP, location, open services.

Used Shodan to detect active services and ports.

Identified exposed services and analyzed potential security risks.

Documented the information with the IP and hostname masked for privacy.

🌐 Shodan Results – General Information
Field	Detail
Masked IP	103.186.68.xxx
Masked Hostname	103.186.xx.xxx
Location	Bengaluru, Karnataka, India
ISP/Org	Gatik Greenergy Pvt Ltd
Service Type	Public Proxy Server
ASN	AS132559
Latitude	12.9762 (12° 58′ 34.43″ N)
Longitude	77.6033 (77° 36′ 11.83″ E)

🔓 Open Ports and Services (Based on Shodan Filters)
Port	Service	Description
88	Sunny WebBox	HTTP web interface for a solar inverter (Server: Sunny WebBox)
8000	Webcam Interface	HTTP Basic Auth realm: "Ronkorama Webcams" (Server: BBVS/4.0)

📊 Service Analysis
🌞 Port 88 – Sunny WebBox
Response: HTTP 200 OK

Server Header: Sunny WebBox

Last Modified: Sat, 12 Jul 2025

Security Issue: Plain HTTP (no encryption); potentially outdated firmware.

📹 Port 8000 – Webcam Interface
Response: HTTP 401 Unauthorized (Basic Authentication Required)

Realm: "Ronkorama Webcams"

Server Header: BBVS/4.0

Security Issue: Uses HTTP, exposing credentials; likely uses default login settings.

⚠️ Security Analysis
Issue	Risk Description
Unencrypted Traffic	Both services use HTTP, allowing sensitive data to be intercepted in transit.
Weak Authentication	Basic Auth can be brute-forced or sniffed, especially if default creds are used.
IoT Exposure	Devices like Sunny WebBox often have known vulnerabilities if not updated.
Global Access	No IP-based access control or firewall protection visible on these ports.

🔐 Recommendations
Area	Recommended Action
🔑 Authentication	Change default credentials; consider disabling Basic Auth entirely
🔒 Encryption	Enable HTTPS using valid TLS certificates
🚫 Access Control	Use a firewall or router rules to block external access to ports 88 and 8000
🧰 Updates	Regularly update the firmware of Sunny WebBox and webcam systems
🧱 Network Design	Place devices behind a VPN or isolate them on a private internal network
🧪 Monitoring	Periodically audit using Shodan or similar tools to check for accidental exposure

✅ Conclusion
This assignment highlights how easily accessible information about public IP addresses can pose real-world security risks. By using Shodan, it becomes clear that devices like webcams or inverters can be exposed without proper configurations. Proactive measures such as encryption, access control, and regular audits are essential to protect systems from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
